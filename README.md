# Sales Analytics Model

Sales Analytics Model is a database project that simulates the management of a retail sales environment. It was designed to ensure data persistence, maintain data quality, and support high-performance queries.

The project uses PostgreSQL as the database system and implements PL/pgSQL for procedural operations such as triggers, functions, and stored procedures.
